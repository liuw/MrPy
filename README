This project aims to create a MapReduce framework in Python for teaching purpose. Why python? Simple and clear.

It should not be too complex to understand. So it's better to adapt Hadoop's Streaming method - input from stdin, output to stdout.

As for distributed file system, I have no plan yet. Just use NFS and it will serve your purpose.
